==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*textobj-indent-introduction*

*textobj-indent* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select a block of
lines which are similarly indented to the current line.

For example, if the content of a buffer as follows:
(here ">" means the current line under the cursor,
and "_" means a space to indent)
>
	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	> __if another_condition_is_satisfied
	  ____call s:do_x()
	  __endif

	  __...
	  __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif
<
|<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| will select lines as follows:
(here "|" indicates the selected line)
>
	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	>|__if another_condition_is_satisfied
	 |____call s:do_x()
	 |__endif
	 |
	 |__...
	 |__endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif
<
|<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)| will select lines as follows:
>
	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	>|__if another_condition_is_satisfied
	 |____call s:do_x()
	 |__endif

	  __...
	  __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif
<
More variants are also available.  See |textobj-indent-mapping| for the
details.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.8 or later (vimscript#2100)

INTERFACE					*textobj-indent-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*textobj-indent-mappings*

These key mappings are defined in Visual mode and Operator-pending mode.

<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)			*<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)*
			Select a block of lines which are similarly indented
			to the current line.  More precisely, it selects lines
			which are:
			- adjacent to the current line, and
			- indented the same or more amount
			  as the current line, or empty line.

			If the current line is empty, the indentation of the
			next line will be used to select.  If that line is
			also ampty, the indentation of the next line of that
			line will be used instead.  And so forth.

			See also |textobj-indent-introduction| for figures
			which describe what lines to be selected by this
			command.

<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)			*<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)|, but it doesn't
			include empty lines.

<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-a)		       *<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-a)*
<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-i)		       *<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-i)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| or
			|<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)|, but select a block of
			lines with the same indentation level, not including
			lines which are more indented than the current line.

			For example, suppose you edit the following text:
			(here ">" denotes the cursor position and "|" denotes
			the current selection.)
>
				  if some_condition_is_satisfied
				    call special_stuff()
				> endif
				  call normal_stuff()
<
			|<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-a)| selects lines as
			follows:
>
				  if some_condition_is_satisfied
				    call special_stuff()
				>|endif
				 |call normal_stuff()
<
			While |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| selects lines as
			follows:
>
				 |if some_condition_is_satisfied
				 |  call special_stuff()
				>|endif
				 |call normal_stuff()
<

CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-indent-customizing*

				    *g:textobj_indent_no_default_key_mappings*
					    *:TextobjIndentDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_indent_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is loaded
(e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use |:TextobjIndentDefaultKeyMappings|
to redefine these key mappings.  This command doesn't override existing {lhs}s
unless [!] is given.

	{lhs}	{rhs}			~
	-----	----------------------	~
	ai	<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)
	ii	<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)
	aI	<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-a)
	iI	<Plug>(textobj-indent-same-i)




==============================================================================
BUGS						*textobj-indent-bugs*

- The current selection is not extended like |aw| nor |ip|
  whenever |<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| or |<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)| is
  repeated in Visual mode.

- So that [count] is just ignored.

- See |textobj-user-bugs| for further information.
